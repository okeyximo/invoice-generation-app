# Invoice Service Link Generator System

## Overview
This project implements a link generator system for an invoice service. The system enables the company to send unique transaction links to customers, allowing them to view details of generated invoices and make payments for those invoices.

## Features
- **Create Invoice:** Generates a new invoice based on the provided request.
- **Generate Invoice Link:** Generates a unique transaction link for a given invoice ID.

## Technologies
- **Java:** Core language used for implementation.
- **Spring Boot:** Framework utilized for building the application.
- **JUnit:** Testing framework for unit tests.
- **H2 Database:** Embedded in-memory database used for data storage.

## Assumptions
- The system is designed to integrate with existing services for generating invoices and processing payments.
- No specific requirements are provided regarding user authentication or authorization.

## Structure
- `InvoiceServiceImpl.java`: Implementation of the `InvoiceService` interface, providing methods for creating invoices and generating transaction links.
- `InvoiceService.java`: Interface defining methods for invoice-related operations.
- `Invoice.java`: Entity class representing an invoice, including details such as invoice number, total amount, and invoice items.
- `InvoiceItem.java`: Entity class representing an item within an invoice.
- `InvoiceRequest.java`: DTO (Data Transfer Object) representing a request to create an invoice.
- `InvoiceResponse.java`: DTO representing a response containing invoice details.
- `InvoiceRepository.java`: Interface for interacting with the database to perform CRUD operations on invoices.
- `application.yaml`: Configuration file containing application properties, including database settings.

## Code Quality
- **Adherence to Java Conventions:** The code follows Java's conventions and idioms to maintain consistency and readability.
- **Cleanliness/Clarity:** Variable and method names are chosen to clearly convey their purpose and intent.
- **Consistent Style:** While no specific code style is enforced, consistency in naming and formatting is maintained throughout the codebase.
- **Maintainability:** The code is designed to be flexible, allowing for easy modification and extension.
- **Testability:** The code is structured to facilitate unit testing, with clear separation of concerns and dependency injection.

## Testing
- Unit tests are provided for the `InvoiceServiceImpl` class to ensure the correctness of invoice creation and link generation functionalities.

## Next Steps
- Integration with external systems for invoice generation and payment processing.
- Implementation of user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Implementation of payment link expiration.
- Deployment of the application to a production environment.
